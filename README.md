# UFOs

Using JavaScript, BootStrap, HTML, and CSS to build a dynamic webpage that organizes UFO sightings 

## Project Overview

The project aims to add to a working dynamic webpage that allows users to see organized data on UFO sightings. This is accomplished by providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape are added. 


## Challenge Overview

1. The purpose of this project was to use HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a webpage that is easy to view, includes filters, images, and a synopsis of the topic. 

2. Data that is stored as a JavaScript array or list is used to build a table that organizes the information that will visually change as "events" change (i.e. filtering) from user input. 

3. Javascript functions are used to loop through the data to create the table and create a customized dashboard. 

4. Filters are created using JavaScript and HTML - these will document the data when an element has changed and develop an interactive webpage.

5. Data is displayed in the table created, and a button click is used to trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria.
