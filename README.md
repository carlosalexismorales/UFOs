# UFOs

Using JavaScript, BootStrap, HTML, and CSS to build a dynamic webpage that organizes UFO sightings 

## Project Overview

The project aims to add to a working dynamic webpage that allows users to see organized data on UFO sightings. This is accomplished by providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape are added. 


## Challenge Overview

1. The purpose of this project was to use HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a webpage that is easy to view, includes filters, images, and a synopsis of the topic. 

2. Data that is stored as a JavaScript array or list is used to build a table that organizes the information that will visually change as "events" change (i.e. filtering) from user input. 

3. Javascript functions are used to loop through the data to create the table and create a customized dashboard. 

4. Filters are created using JavaScript and HTML - these will document the data when an element has changed and develop an interactive webpage.

5. Data is displayed in the table created, and a button click is used to trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria.

### UFO Sightings: The Truth is Out There!


In the images below, we see how the website initially looks like when we first visit the page.

In the images below, the navigation bar and search criteria are highlighted to show how one can reinitilzie the web page and how the table can be updated. One must simply click on the navbar to refresh and clear search results. These search criteria can be changed individually or collectively, meaning one either choose to type in one criteria or multiple ones. As a result of the user's input, the table will update accordingly.

## Summary

### Drawbacks

While this dynamic webpage serves its purpose, there are several drawbacks that are holding back it's true potiental 

1. The user must have preexisting knowledge of the data in order to enter it into the search criteria. This website does not scrape data around the internet, rather, it takees data from a specific file in order to spurn out results. This hinders the user's ability to find more data on the subject. 
2. The search criteria also requires the user to input the data in a case senstive manner. For example, a user has to input the date format exactly how the placeholder shows it to be - anything otherwise will not return any results.
